# 📝 **Publications Section Layout Fix - Unresolved**

## 🎯 **Original Goal**
Fix the ugly mobile layout of the Publications and Media section by using more Tailwind utilities.

## 🔄 **What We Attempted**

### **1. Initial Refactor (✅ Completed)**
- **Replaced custom CSS** with Tailwind utilities for publications
- **Removed ~100 lines** of custom `.publications-*` CSS from `src/style.css`
- **Added responsive classes** for mobile/desktop differences

### **2. Layout Problem Identified (❌ Never Resolved)**
**User's Request:** Pills and buttons should be **across the bottom** of each publication card, with title/source taking **full width** at top.

**Desired Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title text here (full width)        │
│ Source name (full width)            │
│ [A] [2025]               [↗]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Actual Problem:** Pills kept appearing **inline with title text**, making mobile layout cramped and ugly.

## 🔧 **Failed Approaches Tried**

### **Attempt 1: Mobile-Responsive Classes**
```css
flex-col sm:flex-row
text-xs sm:text-sm
px-1.5 py-0.5 sm:px-2 sm:py-1
```
**Result:** Still cramped, stacking was awkward

### **Attempt 2: Simplified Horizontal Layout**
```css
flex justify-between items-center
```
**Result:** Pills still appeared next to title

### **Attempt 3: Explicit Container Separation**
```html
<!-- Title and source section - full width -->
<div class="w-full mb-3">...</div>
<!-- Pills and link section - separate row at bottom -->
<div class="w-full flex justify-between items-center">...</div>
```
**Result:** Layout still broken

### **Attempt 4: CSS Grid Approach**
```css
grid grid-rows-2 gap-3
```
**Result:** Unknown (never tested)

## 🚫 **Core Issue Never Resolved**
Despite multiple attempts with different CSS approaches, the publications cards never achieved the desired layout where:
- Title and source have full width at top
- Pills and button are cleanly separated at bottom
- Mobile layout looks clean and uncrumped

## 📱 **Screenshots Showed**
- Pills appearing inline with title text
- Cramped, ugly mobile layout
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment

## 💡 **For Future Resolution**
1. **Debug the actual HTML output** to see what's really happening
2. **Test each change** with build/preview instead of assuming
3. **Consider CSS inspection** to identify conflicting styles
4. **Maybe use simpler CSS** without complex responsive classes
5. **Possibly revert to custom CSS** if Tailwind utilities aren't working
6. **Check for existing CSS conflicts** that might be interfering

## 🎯 **Success Criteria (Still Unmet)**
- Title takes full width at top of each card
- Source appears below title
- Pills and link button are in dedicated bottom row
- Clean, spacious mobile layout
- Consistent across all screen sizes

## 📁 **Files Involved**
- `src/main.ts` - Publication HTML generation (lines 62-94)
- `src/style.css` - Custom CSS (publications section removed)
- `src/data/publications.json` - Data source

## 🔧 **Current State**
The fundamental layout structure was never successfully implemented despite multiple different CSS approaches. The publications section works functionally but has poor mobile UX due to layout issues.

## 🚫 **SECTION TEMPORARILY HIDDEN**
**Date:** Current session  
**Location:** `src/main.ts` lines 121-136 (commented out)  
**Reason:** Mobile layout remains broken and ugly  
**Action:** Entire Publications and Media section commented out to improve overall page UX  
**TODO:** Fix layout issues and re-enable the section
