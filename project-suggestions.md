### 5. **AI Personality Modes**
- Trigger: Type different commands to change AI assistant personality:
  - `sudo personality --foreman` ‚Üí Tough construction foreman
  - `sudo personality --architect` ‚Üí Sophisticated architect
  - `sudo personality --engineer` ‚Üí Technical engineer

## üîß Technical Implementation Suggestions

### AI/ML Components
```typescript
// Example: AI-powered material estimation
class MaterialEstimator {
  private model: tf.LayersModel;
  
  async estimateMaterials(blueprintData: ImageData): Promise<MaterialList> {
    const processed = await this.preprocessBlueprint(blueprintData);
    const prediction = this.model.predict(processed);
    return this.interpretPrediction(prediction);
  }
}
```

### WebGL/Three.js 3D Visualization
```typescript
// Example: Interactive 3D building model
class BuildingVisualizer {
  private scene: THREE.Scene;
  private camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera;
  private renderer: THREE.WebGLRenderer;
  
  loadBuildingModel(modelPath: string) {
    // Load and display 3D building model
    // Add interactive hotspots for different building systems
  }
}
```

### Computer Vision Integration
```typescript
// Example: Progress tracking from photos
class ProgressTracker {
  async analyzeProgressPhoto(photo: File): Promise<ProgressReport> {
    const canvas = await this.preprocessImage(photo);
    const features = await this.extractFeatures(canvas);
    return this.calculateProgress(features);
  }
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### Micro-Interactions
- **Hover Effects**: Tools that "activate" when hovered (drill bits spin, hammers swing)
- **Loading Animations**: Construction-themed loading screens (crane building the progress bar)
- **Particle Effects**: Dust particles when "demolishing" or "building" UI elements

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly controls for mobile construction workers
- **Tablet Mode**: Optimized for tablet use on construction sites
- **Desktop Power User**: Advanced features for office-based project managers
